    <h1>The Story of an Everyday Programmer</h1>

    <p>Hello there, fellow web surfer. I'm sure if you're anything like me then this is probably your 87th tab open as you search for the right piece of information or entertainment. It's something that most people don't give a second thought to, but as a web developer it's something that I find absolutely fascinating. For every page we visit, the images, text, and layout are the results of a person or team coming together to create something special for you, the user.</p>

    <p>I'm Fernando, and web development is a little thing I've been learning about and working on for quite some time. Ever since high school, my hobby of programming and messing around with the terminal is what's lead me to where I am today. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the building blocks for most of the websites we see today, and it's something that I'm proud to be a part of. Coming up with a concept and turning it into something I can physically see and share with the world is what I love most about web development, and I'm sure you'll love what I have to offer.</p>
